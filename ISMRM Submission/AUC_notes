When using normalized units, the area under the curve (often referred to as simply the AUC) is equal to the probability that 
a classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative one (assuming 'positive' 
ranks higher than 'negative'). In other words, when given one randomly selected positive instance and one randomly selected 
negative instance, AUC is the probability that the classifier will be able to tell which one is which.
